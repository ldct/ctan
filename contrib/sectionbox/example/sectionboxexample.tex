\begin{sectionbox}{Connected Operators}
Connected operators are a subset of morphological image and signal
processing operators which are strongly shape preserving. They
can perform both high and low level image processing tasks
such as noise removal and object recognition respectively.

\begin{sectionbox}{Extensions to Attributes}
By choosing the object properties or \emph{attributes} on which
filtering is based, it is possible to obtain many different types of
filter. More importantly, it is possible to filter in ways invariant
to operations such as rotation, translation and scaling, providing
filtering based on shape, rather than size.

\caption{Scale-invariant filtering of magnetic resonance angiogram
  using elongation criteria.}
\end{figure}

In the above examples, scalar attributes are used in connected
filters, but using vector-attributes has been developed here, and
allows even more control over the filtering process.
\end{sectionbox}

\vfill
\begin{sectionbox}{Extensions to Connectivity}
Connected filters use the notion of connectivity, and various
theoretical extensions are available (see poster ``Generalized 
connected morphological opertors for robust shape extraction'').
\end{sectionbox}\\
\begin{sectionbox}{Pattern Spectra}
Connected filters allow very fast computation of so-called
patter-spectra. These are histograms of the amount of image content in
different shape and size categories (see Figure~\ref{fig:spectra}).
These methods could also be used for content-based image retrieval.

\begin{sectionbox}{Algorithm Development}
New algorithms for area and attribute openings and closings based on
Tarjan's union-find have been developed. These are currently the
fastest algorithms available, and form the basis of a parallel
implementation being developed.
