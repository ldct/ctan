\begin{abstract} \small\baselineskip=9pt This is the text of my abstract. It is a brief
description of my
paper, outlining the purposes and goals I am trying to address.\end{abstract}

\section{Problem Specification.}In this paper, we consider the solution of the $N \times
N$ linear
system
\begin{equation} \label{e1.1}
A x = b
\end{equation}
where $A$ is large, sparse, symmetric, and positive definite.  We consider
the direct solution of (\ref{e1.1}) by means of general sparse Gaussian
elimination.  In such a procedure, we find a permutation matrix $P$, and
compute the decomposition
\[
P A P^{t} = L D L^{t}
\]
where $L$ is unit lower triangular and $D$ is diagonal.  

 
\section{Design Considerations.}Several good ordering algorithms (nested dissection and
minimum degree)
are available for computing $P$  \cite{GEORGELIU}, \cite{ROSE72}.
Since our interest here does not
focus directly on the ordering, we assume for convenience that $P=I$,
or that $A$ has been preordered to reflect an appropriate choice of $P$.

Our purpose here is to examine the nonnumerical complexity of the
sparse elimination algorithm given in  \cite{BANKSMITH}.
As was shown there, a general sparse elimination scheme based on the
bordering algorithm requires less storage for pointers and
row/column indices than more traditional implementations of general
sparse elimination.  This is accomplished by exploiting the m-tree,
a particular spanning tree for the graph of the filled-in matrix.

\begin{theorem} The method  was extended to three
dimensions. For the standard multigrid
coarsening
(in which, for a given grid, the next coarser grid has $1/8$
as many points), anisotropic problems require plane
relaxation to
obtain a good smoothing factor.\end{theorem} 

Our purpose here is to examine the nonnumerical complexity of the
sparse elimination algorithm given in  \cite{BANKSMITH}.
As was shown there, a general sparse elimination scheme based on the
bordering algorithm requires less storage for pointers and
row/column indices than more traditional implementations of general
sparse elimination.  This is accomplished by exploiting the m-tree,
a particular spanning tree for the graph of the filled-in matrix.
Several good ordering algorithms (nested dissection and minimum degree)
are available for computing $P$  \cite{GEORGELIU}, \cite{ROSE72}.
Since our interest here does not
focus directly on the ordering, we assume for convenience that $P=I$,
or that $A$ has been preordered to reflect an appropriate choice of $P$.

\begin{proof} In this paper we consider two methods. The first method
is
basically the method considered with two differences:
first, we perform plane relaxation by a two-dimensional
multigrid method, and second, we use a slightly different
choice of
interpolation operator, which improves performance
for nearly singular problems. In the second method coarsening
is done by successively coarsening in each of the three
independent variables and then ignoring the intermediate
grids; this artifice simplifies coding considerably.
\end{proof}

sparse elimination algorithm given in  \cite{BANKSMITH}.

bordering algorithm requires less storage for pointers and
row/column indices than more traditional implementations of general
sparse elimination.  This is accomplished by exploiting the m-tree,
a particular spanning tree for the graph of the filled-in matrix.

discuss
some remaining details.}

\begin{lemma} We discuss first the choice for $I_{k-1}^k$
which is a generalization. We assume that $G^{k-1}$ is
obtained
from $G^k$
by standard coarsening; that is, if $G^k$ is a tensor product
grid $G_{x}^k \times G_{y}^k \times G_{z}^k$,
$G^{k-1}=G_{x}^{k-1} \times G_{y}^{k-1} \times G_{z}^{k-1}$,
where $G_{x}^{k-1}$ is obtained by deleting every other grid
point of $G_x^k$ and similarly for $G_{y}^k$ and $G_{z}^k$.
\end{lemma}
 
To our knowledge, the m-tree previously has not been applied in this
fashion to the numerical factorization, but it has been used,
directly or indirectly, in several optimal order algorithms for
computing the fill-in during the symbolic factorization phase
[4] - [10], [5], [6]. In \S 1.3., we analyze the complexity of the old and new
approaches to the intersection problem for the special case of
an $n \times n$ grid ordered by nested dissection. The special
structure of this problem allows us to make exact estimates of
the complexity. To our knowledge, the m-tree previously has not been applied in this
fashion to the numerical factorization, but it has been used,

In \S 1.2, we review the bordering algorithm, and introduce
the sorting and intersection problems that arise in the
sparse formulation of the algorithm.

For the old approach, we show that the
complexity of the intersection problem is $O(n^{3})$, the same
as the complexity of the numerical computations.  For the
new approach, the complexity of the second part is reduced to
$O(n^{2} (\log n)^{2})$.

\subsection{Robustness.}\ We do not
attempt to present an overview
here, but rather attempt to focus on those results that
are relevant to our particular algorithm.
This section assumes prior knowledge of the role of graph theory
in sparse Gaussian elimination; surveys of this role are
available in \cite{ROSE72} and \cite{GEORGELIU}. More general
discussions of elimination trees are given in
\cite{LAW} - \cite{LIU2}, \cite{SCHREIBER}.
Thus, at the $k$th stage, the bordering algorithm consists of
solving the lower triangular system
\begin{equation} \label{1.2}
 L_{k-1}v = c
\end{equation}
and setting
\begin{eqnarray} 
\ell &=& D^{-1}_{k-1}v , \\
\delta &=& \alpha - \ell^{t} v .
\end{eqnarray}
