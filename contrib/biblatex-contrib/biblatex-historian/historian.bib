From: ``Petersen, Chris`` <chris.petersen@orst.edu> 

News Release News Release News Release News Release Linus Pauling DNA website unveiled http://osulibrary.orst.edu/specialcollections/dna Oregon State University Libraries Special Collections will launch on Thursday, February 20th a new website, ``Linus Pauling and the Race for DNA: A Documentary History.`` The website, at http://osulibrary.orst.edu/specialcollections/dna, explores one of the greatest scientific achievements of the 20th century - the discovery of the structure of deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, the basic foundation of life. More than 800 original letters, manuscripts, photographs, audio-clips and video excerpts - many never before available outside of archives - form the heart of the site. They include a number of important and unique items, such as:

        * An extremely rare prepublication typescript of James Watson and Francis Crick's groundbreaking DNA paper;

        * A one-of-a-kind prepublication typescript of Rosalind Franklin's DNA paper, published in the same issue of ``Nature`` as Watson and Crick's, with handwritten additions by Franklin;

        * Linus Pauling's contemporaneous laboratory notes outlining his DNA work, and a much-corrected manuscript of the paper relating his famously mistaken structure;

        * Scores of manuscript letters written at the time, including correspondence between all the major players in the race for DNA.  The original documents are tied together with a unique narrative of the discovery from the largely unknown viewpoint of the major ``loser`` in the race, Pauling. A comprehensive, day-by-day account of all of Pauling's personal and professional activities in the years 1952 and 1953 is also included as an adjunct to the main DNA narrative, with scanned images of documents and photographs accompanying the text.

``This site is for anyone interested in the DNA story,`` said Clifford Mead, head of Special Collections at OSU. ``General users can benefit from an interesting site that shows history in the making, through the words of the participants.  The site also offers a comprehensive set of links to other DNA sites, as well detailed information on all the major players.`` ``But it goes deeper,`` Mead added. ``This site makes available for the first time the raw material of this important piece of history.``

	Annote = {Superficial description of the eggs, cleavage, gastrulation, hatchling---no dissections yet.

Sees continuities with the lampreys below and amphibians above, but not with other fish. 

Doesn't refer much to the ecology here, but makes much of the (secondarily acquired) yolkiness of the egg and the caenogenetic consequences---throws of cleavage and gastrulation, compared to most other fish. Wants them (like Haeckel) in a separate class.

C. develops operculum first, then gills; never has external (larval) gills; doesn't have a proper larva. Also misses the larvalen Saugapparat. Argues against the idea that the Saugscheiben der Lepidosteauslarven and the Anurenlarven are Reminiscenzen eines Cyclostomenstadiums. If the selachians don't have it and these dipnoans don't either, then they must be secondary adaptive acquisitions in the higher groups and have nothing to do with the cyclostomes.},

Posted on: September 18, 2007 9:06 PM, by PZ Myers

Oh, joy. We've got a new crop of persistent Religiots pissing and moaning in the comments. They're whining that I'm mean, that all the regular commenters are mean, that the fact that some good scientists are also Christian somehow validates Christian belief, that I can't criticize scientists who are working at more prestigious universities, and that my tactics are bad. I don't know why they're here; it's not as if we're going to be converted by their inanities, or that they're going to persuade us to accept any of their claims.

Let's break it down into simple sentences and ideas.

Yeah, we're mean. We're actually rather proud of it, so don't waste your breath. Do you also walk up to Keira Knightley and tell her she's beautiful, expecting that she'll start wearing a bag over her head?

We know that you can be a good scientist and religious, and I've never said otherwise. Some great scientists have amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, too. It doesn't mean ALS is a good thing.

Swarms of perfervid Christians and timid agnostics and atheists waving their arms and urgently warning us that atheist strategies aren't working isn't exactly scaring us. It's not as if we're stupid enough to believe you want us to have more effective strategies for deprogramming victims of the church.

You aren't going to deter us.

Here is the bottom line.

There is this old myth about a god who has sex with his human mother to give birth to himself, who grows up to be killed (but not really), and this depreciated sacrifice somehow means everyone else gets to go to heaven when they die. If they believe it, that is; otherwise they go to hell and suffer for eternity.

Now I'm supposed to…

    *

      …believe in this fairy tale myself;
    *

      …believe that accepting this fairy tale helps people be better human beings;
    *

      …believe that accepting this fairy tale helps people be better scientists;
    *

      …regard people who swallow this fairy tale with the same respect I do those who see through the nonsense;
    *

      …refrain from criticizing this fairy tale; and/or
    *

      …pretend this fairy tale isn't a load of ridiculous bullshit.

No, it's never going to happen. I will never accept or even respect your fairy tale.

Sorry.

One more try. Here's a simple statement that, if you grasp it, you will realize there is no point hanging around here anymore.

The Nicene Creed is not a profession of the basic orthodoxy of the Christian faith. It's a rationality test.

If you believe one line of it, you've failed.},

Beeinflussung der seelischen Entwicklung durch inneren Sekretionen, z. B., von Schild-, Zirbel-, Thymusdrüsen sowie von Milz und Nebennieren, und besonders von den Geschlechtsdrüsen.  Steinachs Versuche über Geschlechtsumwandlung sowie seine Hodentransplantationen gegen die Homosexualität.   

``Von Masse und Beschaffenheitinnerer Drüsenstoffe hängt es eben restlos ab, wie ein Mensch denkt, wohin es ihn treibt, welches daher seine Charaktereigenschaften und geistigen Geschicke sind!  Ja wir haben es fest in der Hand, experimentell-therapeutisch die Zusammensetzung jener Drüsenstoffe zu verändern; und alsbald stellt sich uns eine ganz andere Quantität und Qualität Mensch vor!  Aus einem spielerischen, geschlechtsfrenden oder perversen, fettleibigen Duckmäuser wird durch Einführung von Hodensubstanz ein ernster, entschlossener, behaarter, muskelkräftiger, arbeits- und liebesfreudiger Mann!  Aus einem zwergartig untersetzten Trottel mit faltiger, schuppender Haut, rissigen Nägeln, offenen Geschwüren, blödem, glasigem Blick wird durch Einverleibung von Schilddrüsensubstanz ein hochgewachsener, schlanker, glatt- und heilhäutiger, offenblickender und aufgeweckter Mensch.``

``…das seelische Leben ist nicht minder technisch beherrschbar als das körperliche.``

Es besteht sogar die Möglichkeit, nicht nur Minderwertigkeit auszurotten, sondern auch , ``bestimmt gerichtete, geistige Hochwertigkeiten, besonders gewünschte geniale Fähigkeiten hervorzurufen.``}}
