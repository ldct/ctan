This work consists of the files listed in manifest.txt

This work consists of the following files:

manifest.txt		this file
README			basic description and instructions
testhyphens.dtx		auto-extracting documented TeX file
testhyphens.pdf		derived documentation in PDF format
testhyphens.sty		derived .sty file

When you run pdflatex on texthyphens.dtx you get both the documentation and the package file.

Attention: the .dtx contains also some tests in Greek; you can safely typeset the documentation only if you have the necessary TeX facilities for typesetting in Greek (packages and vector fonts); you certainly have them, if you have a complete installation of the TeX system.
